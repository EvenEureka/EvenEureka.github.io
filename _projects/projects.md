Reappearance of classic papers on Group Evolution Game Theory
======
* This project is based on the classic paper "Scale-Free Networks Provide a Unifying Framework for the Emergence of Cooperation" and "Social diversity promotes the emergence of cooperation in public goods games" by F. C. Santos. We reproduce the results of the paper and extend the model to a more general case. We also explore the influence of different parameters on the model and the impact of different initial conditions on the final results.

Check-in GLM, Research Project
======
* Customized Spatial-Temporal data (Check-in Sequence) for LLMs enables these models to generate predictions or insights based on patterns and trends identified in the sequence of check-ins. By feeding LLMs with such data, it becomes possible to model complex human mobility and activity patterns over time and space, allowing for enhanced applications in areas such as targeted advertising, event prediction, and personalized recommendation systems. 


Spatial-Temporal Contrastive Diffusion Model(STCDM) for Check-in Sequence Generation, Research Project
======
* This model introduces a novel spatial-temporal lossless encoding method that effectively encodes spatial and temporal characteristics into a unified format. Furthermore, we utilize two disentangled diffusion modules that are conditioned on each other to capture the correlations between spatial and temporal aspects of check-in sequences, while reducing the impact of noisy interference. Finally, we incorporate contrastive learning to enhance the relationship between the two diffusion modules.


3D Object Detection based on Point Cloud, Competition Project
======
* This project is based on the KITTI dataset and the competition private dataset, and the goal is to detect the 3D objects in the point cloud. The project is implemented by using the TED model. We apply sparse convolutional backbones to extract multi-channel transformed equivariant voxel features and the final result is evaluated by the mAP metric.


A Mid-match Tennis Winner Predictor , Competition Project
* This project is based on the Jeff dataset, and its goal is to predict the winner of the tennis match point by point and mining momentum changes. The project is implemented by using the Transformer model, and the final accuracy rate is as high as 94%.


A Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation, Course Project
======
* Integrated attention into neural networks for heart imaging segmentation. By applying self-attention modules in both the encoder and decoder, the model captures remote dependencies of different scales, enabling a more nuanced understanding of spatial relationships within cardiac images.
