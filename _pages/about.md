I'm a fourth year undergraduate student in Computer Science from [School of Computer and Information Technology](https://scit.bjtu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://www.bjtu.edu.cn/) My research interest includes spatio-temporal data maining, generative AI and group evolution game theory.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof Wan, Huaiyu](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8793/) and [Prof Guo, Shengnan](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9685/) of Institute of Network Science and Intelligent Systems, Beijing Jiaotong University. Check out our new work on NeurIPS24 [Mobility-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00823)!
I was also advised by [Prof LI Aming](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1313/1695.htm) of Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University.
