Reading 
======
* I enjoy reading because I love immersing myself in the worlds created by authors. This immersive experience allows me to explore complex ideas and emotions that extend beyond the confines of my own reality. Reading "1984" by George Orwell, for instance, offered me a glimpse into a dystopian society that reflects on freedom, surveillance, and individuality. Similarly, YU Hua's "To Live" and "Brothers" transport me to different facets of Chinese culture and history, blending tragedy with humor to showcase the resilience of the human spirit. 

Food Hunter
======
* I'm an adventurous foodie who loves to explore different cuisines. I enjoy trying new foods and experimenting with different flavors. I'm particularly fond of spicy food and dessert, and I'm always on the lookout for the next great BBQ restaurant. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with my new recipes. I find that cooking is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day.
